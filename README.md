# theMullFiles

Inspiried by User @phuang repository called theories to write my own thoughts of observations and things that I find myself mulling over, hence the name "theMullFiles"
These thoughts are 100% my own and I do not branch of phuang's work or expand upon it at any point.
Credit towards people who have sent me on this path of thought will be given.

This is a temporary place before I figure out a better way to store these thoughts
