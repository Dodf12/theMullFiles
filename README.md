# theMullFiles

Inspired by User @phuang's repository called theories linked here:
I was inspired to write my thoughts of observations and things that I find myself mulling over, hence the name "theMullFiles"
These thoughts are 100% my own and I do not branch off Phuang's work or expand upon it at any point.
Credit will be given to people who have sent me on this path of thought.

This is a temporary place before I figure out a better way to store these thoughts


My Article Ideas:
-Aura
-Complexity versus Simplicity: the Language Connection
-About Me
-Judgement and its Subtleties
