# theMullFiles

Inspired by User @phuang's repository called theories linked here:
I was inspired to write my thoughts of observations and things that I find myself mulling over, hence the name "theMullFiles"
These thoughts are things that I think about, and they might have been thought about before by others, but this is my representation of that talk.
Credit will be given to people who have sent me on this path of thought.

This is a temporary place before I figure out a better way to store these thoughts


My Article Ideas:
-Aura
-Complexity versus Simplicity: the Language Connection
-About Me
-Judgement and its Subtleties
-Stoicism
